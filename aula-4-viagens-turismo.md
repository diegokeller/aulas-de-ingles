## Reading Comprehension

### Lost in New York City

Lucas is a Brazilian traveler visiting New York City for the first time. He is very excited to explore the Big Apple, but he finds the city a bit overwhelming and crowded. 

Yesterday, he decided to visit Central Park. He left his hotel early in the morning and walked to the nearest **Underground station**. However, when he got there, he realized he didn't have his **boarding pass** for the subway (the MetroCard). He had to find a machine to **book** a new one.

After arriving near the park, Lucas got confused with the streets. He wanted to find the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but he was lost. He decided to use his English skills and approach a local. He saw a woman walking her dog and asked politely: "Excuse me, **could** you help me? I'm looking for the museum. Is it far from here?"

The woman was very kind. She told him: "No, it's not far. Go straight on 5th Avenue for two blocks, then turn right. You will see the museum opposite the park entrance." Lucas thanked her and followed the **directions**.

Inside the museum, he bought some beautiful **souvenirs** for his family in Brazil. He took many photos of the paintings. In the afternoon, he was hungry and found a **local market** where he tried a famous New York hot dog.

Lucas learned that **traveling** is easier when you aren't afraid to ask for help. He is looking forward to his next **trip**!
