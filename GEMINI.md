  ```

### Images

- Format: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-[ID]?w=300&h=200&fit=crop`
- Add attribution: `*Images: [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) (free to use)*`

  ### To bite the dust
  Significa fracassar ou quebrar.
  - *Example: My old vacuum cleaner finally bit the dust.*
  ```

## Exercise Types

### 1. Matching Exercises

Connect concepts with their descriptions by drawing lines. Use tables with a wide, empty middle column to provide space:

| Item | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Description |
|------|:-------------------------------------------------------------:|-------------|
|  X   |                                                               | Description A |
|  Y   |                                                               | Description B |

> **Note:** Use enough `&nbsp;` or spaces in the header of the middle column to ensure it remains wide enough for lines to be drawn when printed.

### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank

Provide sentences with blanks for vocabulary practice:

```
1. Sentence with ________________________.
2. Another sentence with ________________________.
```

Highlight answer options in bold: **Option A**, **Option B**, **Option C**

### 3. Personal Response / Conversation Starters

Tables with space for student writing:

```
| Prompt | Your Answer |
|--------|-------------|
| **Topic 1** | *Example answer in italics* |
| **Topic 2** | |
```

### 4. Conversation Practice (Recommended)

Add dialogue prompts or role-play scenarios:

```
### Conversation Practice

**Situation:** You meet a friend and talk about the weather.

**Student A:** Ask about the weather today.
**Student B:** Describe the current weather and temperature.
**Student A:** Compare it to yesterday's weather.
```

## Grammar Approach

- **Light and contextual** - introduce grammar as it naturally appears in the topic
- Place grammar explanations at the end of a section, not before
- Use simple tables to show patterns:

```
| Noun  | Adjective (+ y) |
|-------|-----------------|
| Sun   | Sunny           |
| Cloud | Cloudy          |
```

- Add brief explanation after the pattern:
  ```
  > **Nota:** We often turn weather nouns into adjectives by adding **-y**.
  ```

## Formatting for Print

- Use `---` horizontal rules to separate major sections
- Keep tables readable (not too wide)
- Use consistent image sizes (300x200 recommended)
- Avoid overly long lines in tables
- Leave space for student writing in exercises

## Language Balance

- **Instructions and explanations:** Portuguese
- **Vocabulary, examples, exercises:** English
- **Key terms:** Always in **bold** when introducing
- **Example sentences:** In *italics*

## File Naming

Use the pattern: `aula-[number]-[topic-in-portuguese].md`

Examples:
- `aula-1-introducao.md`
- `aula-2-estacoes-clima-tempo.md`
- `aula-3-familia-relacionamentos.md`
