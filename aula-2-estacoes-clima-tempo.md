### Desambiguação de "Season"

A palavra em inglês **"Season"** possui dois significados principais que são relevantes no estudo da língua:

1. **Estação do Ano (Season - substantivo):** Refere-se a uma das quatro divisões do ano (Primavera, Verão, Outono, Inverno) que são caracterizadas por variações climáticas. É o sentido explorado nesta lição.
   - *Example: Summer is my favorite season.*

2. **Temperar/Sazonar (To Season - verbo):** Refere-se ao ato de adicionar sal, pimenta ou outras especiarias à comida para melhorar seu sabor.
   - *Example: Don't forget to season the meat before cooking.*

> **Nota:** No contexto de clima e tempo, "season" sempre será usado no sentido de Estação do Ano. O ato de temperar alimentos, apesar de usar a mesma palavra, é um verbo e tem um significado completamente diferente.

## Weather and Climate (Clima e Tempo)

Nesta seção, vamos aprender a descrever o clima e as condições do tempo em inglês.

We use different words to talk about the weather. These words are often derived from nouns:

| Noun | Adjective (often ends in -y) | Example Sentence |
|------|------------------------------|------------------|
| Sun | **Sunny** | It is sunny today. Let's go to the park! |
| Cloud | **Cloudy** | It is cloudy. I think it will rain soon. |
| Rain | **Rainy** | It was a rainy Tuesday when we first met. |
| Snow | **Snowy** | Be careful! It's snowy, and the roads are slippery. |
| Wind | **Windy** | It's too windy to stay outdoors. |
| Storm | **Stormy** | A big stormy day is coming. |
| Fog | **Foggy** | Drive slowly; it's very foggy this morning. |
| Ice | **Icy** | The roads are icy, so watch out for black ice. |
| Mist | **Misty** | The mountain is misty early in the morning. |

> **Nota:** A palavra **hail** (granizo) não segue o padrão -y. Usamos "it's hailing" (está caindo granizo) como verbo.

### Note on Temperature Adjectives

**Hot/Warm** and **Cold/Cool** are adjectives themselves and do not follow the noun-to-adjective pattern with '-y' for the weather.

- *It's hot/warm, about 30 degrees Celsius.*
- *It's cold/cool, only 5 degrees.*

---

### Grammar Explanation

- **Nouns** (e.g., sun, cloud, rain) are words for things.
- We can often turn these weather nouns into **Adjectives** by adding **-y** (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy, windy, stormy).
- These adjectives describe the state of the weather.


### Exercise 4: Match the Weather Condition

Match the weather condition on the left with the correct situation on the right.

| Weather | Answer | Situation |

| 3. Windy | (___) | There's thunder and lightning. It's dangerous to go outside. |

| 7. Icy | (___) | My hat flew away! The air is moving very fast today. |
| 8. Cloudy | (___) | Water is falling from the sky. I need my umbrella. |

### Exercise 5: How is the Weather Today?

**Hints:** What is the temperature? Is it sunny or cloudy? Is there wind? How does the weather make you feel?

| English | Português | | English | Português | | English | Português |
|---------|-----------|---|---------|-----------|---|---------|-----------|
| sky | céu | | to rain | chover | | wet | molhado |

## Reading Comprehension

### A Year in Sarah's Life

Sarah lives in a small town in the south of England. She loves how the weather changes throughout the year.

In **spring**, Sarah wakes up at half past six every morning. The weather is mild and pleasant, and she can hear the birds singing outside her window. The sky is usually cloudy in the morning, but by quarter past ten, the sun starts to shine. Sarah enjoys walking in the park after work, around five o'clock, when the flowers are blooming and the temperature is comfortable — about 15 degrees Celsius.

**Summer** is her favorite season. She wakes up earlier, at six o'clock, because the days are longer and brighter. The weather is hot and sunny, sometimes reaching 28 degrees. At half past twelve, she has lunch outside with her colleagues. On weekends, she goes to the beach. The sky is always blue and clear, perfect for swimming and sunbathing.

When **autumn** arrives, the weather starts to change. Sarah wakes up at quarter to seven because the mornings are darker. The temperature drops to about 10 degrees, and it becomes windy and rainy. She loves watching the leaves change color — red, orange, and brown. By half past five in the afternoon, it's already getting dark. She stays home and drinks hot tea while listening to the wind blow outside.

**Winter** is cold and sometimes snowy. Sarah wakes up at seven o'clock, but outside it's still dark. The temperature is often below zero, and the roads can be icy and dangerous. At quarter past eight, she leaves for work wearing a warm coat. The days are short — by four o'clock, it's already dark. On stormy days, she stays inside and watches the snow fall. She goes to bed early, at half past nine, because she feels sleepy when it's cold and dark.

Sarah thinks every season is beautiful in its own way. The weather changes, but she always finds something to enjoy.
