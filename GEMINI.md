# English Lessons Project - Instructions

## Overview

This project contains English lesson materials for **intermediate level** students who are **native Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) speakers**. The focus is on practical communication skills through exercises and conversation practice.

## Target Audience

- **Level:** Intermediate (B1-B2)
- **Native Language:** Brazilian Portuguese
- **Goal:** Improve conversational English and practical vocabulary

## Content Guidelines

### Structure

Each lesson should follow this hierarchy:

```
# Lesson X: Topic Title
## Goals
## Main Topic
### Subtopic / Disambiguation
### Exercise 1: ...
### Exercise 2: ...
### Exercise 3: ...
## Secondary Topic (if applicable)
### Grammar Explanation (light)
```

**Disambiguation Format:** When clarifying similar terms (e.g., *Travel* vs. *Trip*), use a two-column table for better comparison.

| Term | Explanation and Examples |
|------|--------------------------|
| **Term A** | Explanation in Portuguese.<br>*Example: Sentence in English.* |
| **Term B** | Explanation in Portuguese.<br>*Example: Sentence in English.* |

### Answer Keys

For every lesson created (e.g., `aula-4-viagens-turismo.md`), a corresponding answer key file must be created using the pattern `aula-[number]-[topic]-answers.md` (e.g., `aula-4-viagens-turismo-answers.md`).

- **Synchronization:** The answer key file must always be kept in sync with the lesson file. Any changes to exercises in the lesson file must be reflected in the answer key file immediately.
- **Content:** Include the full text of the question and the correct answer for clarity. For open-ended questions (Personal Response), indicate that answers will vary.
- **Audio Transcripts:** Always include the full **Audio Transcript** for dictation exercises in the answer key for the teacher's use.

### Goals Section

- List 2-3 clear learning objectives
- Mix Portuguese explanation with **English key terms in bold**
- Example:
  ```
  - Aprender e praticar o **vocabulary** relacionado às **seasons** e **weather conditions**.
  ```

### Vocabulary Presentation

- Use tables for vocabulary lists
- Include images when helpful (use Unsplash direct URLs for consistency)
- Always provide Portuguese translations
- Format:
  ```
  | English Term | Português |
  |--------------|-----------|
  | **Spring**   | Primavera |
  ```

### Images

- Use fixed Unsplash URLs (not random/source API) for print consistency
- Format: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-[ID]?w=300&h=200&fit=crop`
- Add attribution: `*Images: [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) (free to use)*`

### Slangs and Idioms

Every lesson **must** include a section with 2-3 related slangs or idiomatic expressions. Use a two-column table for better readability.

| Slang / Idiom | Meaning and Example |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **To bite the dust** | Significa fracassar ou quebrar.<br>*Example: My old vacuum cleaner finally bit the dust.* |

## Exercise Types

### 1. Matching Exercises

Connect concepts with their descriptions by drawing lines. Use tables with a wide, empty middle column to provide space. **Do not use numbers** for the items.

| Item | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Description |
|------|:-------------------------------------------------------------:|-------------|
|  X   |                                                               | Description A |
|  Y   |                                                               | Description B |

> **Note:** Use enough `&nbsp;` or spaces in the header of the middle column to ensure it remains wide enough for lines to be drawn when printed.

### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank

Provide sentences with long blanks for vocabulary practice. Use at least 40 underscores (`_`) to provide enough space for student writing when printed.

```
1. Sentence with ________________________________________.
2. Another sentence with ________________________________________.
```

Highlight answer options in bold: **Option A**, **Option B**, **Option C**

### 3. Personal Response / Production

Tables or lists with ample space for student writing. Use at least 80 underscores for longer answers.

```
| Prompt | Your Answer |
|--------|-------------|
| **Topic 1** | *Example answer in italics* |
| **Topic 2** | __________________________________________________________________________________________ |
```

### 4. Conversation Practice (Recommended)

Add dialogue prompts or role-play scenarios:

```
### Conversation Practice

**Situation:** You meet a friend and talk about the weather.

**Student A:** Ask about the weather today.
**Student B:** Describe the current weather and temperature.
**Student A:** Compare it to yesterday's weather.
```

### 5. Dictation Exercises

Include sentences or short dialogues for listening practice.

- **Audio Transcripts:** Do **NOT** include the actual audio text in the student lesson file. Instead, place the transcript in the corresponding **Answer Key** file for the teacher's reference.
- **Student Instruction:** Use the phrase: *"Listen to the audio provided by your teacher and answer the questions."*

**Format A: Fill-in-the-blanks**
Provide sentences with one or more blanks to be filled while listening.

```
1. I usually ________ to the ________ in the morning.
2. She ________ ________ because it was raining.
```

**Format B: Comprehension Questions**
Ask multiple short, specific questions based on the context of the dictated sentence or dialogue.

```
1. What is the first place the speaker is looking for?
   **Answer:** ____________________________________________________

2. What is the speaker's specific problem?
   **Answer:** ____________________________________________________
```

## Grammar Approach

- **Light and contextual** - introduce grammar as it naturally appears in the topic
- Place grammar explanations at the end of a section, not before
- Use simple tables to show patterns:

```
| Noun  | Adjective (+ y) |
|-------|-----------------|
| Sun   | Sunny           |
| Cloud | Cloudy          |
```

- Add brief explanation after the pattern:
  ```
  > **Nota:** We often turn weather nouns into adjectives by adding **-y**.
  ```

### Grammar Concept Tracking

Maintain a centralized document (`grammar-tracker.md`) to keep track of grammar concepts covered in each lesson. This ensures a logical progression and helps plan future lessons.

- **Columns:** Concept Name, Lesson Number, Status (✅ Learned), and Description.
- **Future Planning:** Include a list of suggested grammar topics for upcoming lessons based on the remaining "Recommended Topics for Intermediate Level".
- **Update Rule:** Every time a new lesson is created with a grammar focus, the `grammar-tracker.md` file must be updated.

## Formatting for Print

- Use `---` horizontal rules to separate major sections
- Keep tables readable (not too wide)
- Use consistent image sizes (300x200 recommended)
- Avoid overly long lines in tables
- Leave space for student writing in exercises

## Language Balance

- **Instructions and explanations:** Portuguese
- **Vocabulary, examples, exercises:** English
- **Key terms:** Always in **bold** when introducing
- **Example sentences:** In *italics*

## File Naming

Use the pattern: `aula-[number]-[topic-in-portuguese].md`

Examples:
- `aula-1-introducao.md`
- `aula-2-estacoes-clima-tempo.md`
- `aula-3-familia-relacionamentos.md`
