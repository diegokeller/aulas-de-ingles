## Reading Comprehension

### A Busy Saturday at the Miller House

The Miller family is very busy every Saturday. Since everyone works or goes to school during the week, Saturday is the day to **do the housework**.

Mr. Miller **always** wakes up early to **make breakfast** for everyone. After eating, he **usually** **takes out the trash** and **waters the plants** in the garden. He **often** says he enjoys being outside.

Mrs. Miller is responsible for the laundry. She **always** **does the laundry** on Saturday mornings. While the machine is working, she **usually** **dusts the furniture** in the living room. She **never** forgets to **vacuum** the carpets because they have a cat, and there is fur everywhere.

Their son, Leo, has his own responsibilities. He **must** **make his bed** every day, but on Saturdays, he also has to **tidy up** his room and **mop the floor**. He **sometimes** grumbles about it, but he knows it's important.

In the afternoon, they all work together in the kitchen. They **make lunch** together, and after that, Leo and his father **wash the dishes** while Mrs. Miller **dries** them and puts them away. 

By 4 PM, the house is clean and tidy. They **usually** go to the park or watch a movie to relax. They believe that sharing the chores **makes** the work faster and more fun.
